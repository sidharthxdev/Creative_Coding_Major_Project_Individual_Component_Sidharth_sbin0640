*For the tutor: Please not that for my individual component I had to create a new repository as I wasn't able to fork my repository*

### Concept: Time Interval Based

#### Simple and Automatic Experience:

- Load the page and the animation will begin immediately
- The animation is fully automatic - no user interaction required
- Watch as new circles spawn every second from existing circles
- Circles will bounce around the screen continuously
- Each circle displays unique patterns (rings, dots, or combinations)
- The animation adapts to your screen size automatically 
- Resize your browser window to see the canvas adjust dynamically

#### What to Expect:

- The animation starts with one circle at the center of the screen
- Every second, a new circle appears at the location of a randomly selected existing circle
- Circles move slowly across the screen and bounce off the edges
- Each circle displays one of three randomly assigned pattern types
- Colors are randomly generated for each pattern element
- The animation continues indefinitely, creating an ever-growing ecosystem of moving patterns
